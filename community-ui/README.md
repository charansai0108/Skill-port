# Community Tab UI

This folder contains the static UI for the SkillPort Community Tab, built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It includes role-based pages for Admin, Mentor, and User, matching the original project structure and design requirements.

## Structure

- `assets/` — Images, icons, and other static assets
- `css/` — Tailwind CSS files
- `js/` — JavaScript for interactivity
- `components/` — Reusable HTML components (navbar, modals, etc.)
- `pages/` — Main pages for each role and feature

## Getting Started
Open any HTML file in the `pages/` directory to view the UI. All data is static/mock for now. The UI is fully responsive and matches the original design.
