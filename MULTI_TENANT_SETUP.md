# 🏢 Multi-Tenant Community System - Implementation Status

## ✅ **What's Been Completed:**

### 1. Database Schema ✅
- Added `slug` field to Community model (optional, unique)
- Schema supports multi-tenant architecture
- Applied to database successfully

### 2. Utility Functions ✅
- Created `/lib/slugify.ts` with slug generation
- Generates URL-friendly slugs from community names
- Unique slug generation with random suffix

### 3. Backend APIs ✅
- Updated `/api/auth/register` - Generates slug on community creation
- Updated `/api/auth/login` - Returns community slug, redirects to `/community/{slug}/dashboard`
- Created `/api/community/[slug]` - Fetches community data by slug
- All admin APIs support multi-tenant filtering

### 4. Dynamic Routes ✅
- Created folder structure: `/app/community/[communitySlug]/`
- Dashboard page created at `/community/[communitySlug]/dashboard`
- Uses `useParams()` to get communitySlug from URL
- Navigation links updated to use dynamic slug

---

## 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

### **Registration Flow:**
1. Admin registers → Community created with unique slug
2. Slug generated from community name (e.g., "My Hub" → "my-hub-abc1")
3. Admin receives community code AND slug
4. After OTP verification → Ready to login

### **Login Flow:**
1. Admin logs in with email/password
2. Backend returns `redirectUrl: /community/{slug}/dashboard`
3. Frontend redirects to community-specific dashboard
4. All navigation uses community slug in URLs

### **Multi-Tenant Benefits:**
- ✅ Each community has unique URLs
- ✅ Multiple communities can exist independently  
- ✅ Data is isolated by communityId
- ✅ Admins only see their community's data
- ✅ SEO-friendly URLs with community names

## 🚧 **What Still Needs to Be Done:**

### **Create Remaining Community Pages:**

Copy from `/app/admin/*` to `/app/community/[communitySlug]/*`:

```bash
# Students page
cp apps/web/app/admin/users/page.tsx apps/web/app/community/[communitySlug]/students/page.tsx

# Mentors page  
cp apps/web/app/admin/mentors/page.tsx apps/web/app/community/[communitySlug]/mentors/page.tsx

# Contests page
cp apps/web/app/admin/contests/page.tsx apps/web/app/community/[communitySlug]/contests/page.tsx

# Analytics page
cp apps/web/app/admin/analytics/page.tsx apps/web/app/community/[communitySlug]/analytics/page.tsx

# Leaderboard page
cp apps/web/app/admin/leaderboard/page.tsx apps/web/app/community/[communitySlug]/leaderboard/page.tsx

# Profile page
cp apps/web/app/admin/profile/page.tsx apps/web/app/community/[communitySlug]/profile/page.tsx
```

### **Update Each Copied Page:**

For each page, make these changes:

1. **Add useParams:**
```typescript
import { useParams } from 'next/navigation'

const params = useParams()
const communitySlug = params.communitySlug as string
```

2. **Update Navigation Links:**
```typescript
// OLD:
<Link href="/admin/dashboard">

// NEW:
<Link href={`/community/${communitySlug}/dashboard`}>
```

3. **Update Page Title:**
```typescript
<h1>{communityData?.name || 'PW IOI'}</h1>
```

4. **Fetch Community Data:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchCommunityData()
}, [communitySlug])

const fetchCommunityData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/community/${communitySlug}`)
  const result = await response.json()
  setCommunityData(result.data.community)
}
```

## 🧪 **Testing:**

### Test 1: Register New Community
```bash
POST /api/auth/register
{
  "name": "Test Admin",
  "email": "test@community.com",
  "password": "Test@123",
  "role": "ADMIN",
  "communityName": "Test Learning Hub"
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Community created with slug: `test-learning-hub-xxxx`
- Returns slug in response
- OTP sent for verification

### Test 2: Login
```bash
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "test@community.com",
  "password": "Test@123"
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Returns: `redirectUrl: "/community/test-learning-hub-xxxx/dashboard"`
- User redirected to their community's dashboard

### Test 3: Access Community Dashboard
```
Visit: http://localhost:3000/community/test-learning-hub-xxxx/dashboard
```

**Expected Result:**
- Shows community name in navbar
- Shows community-specific data
- All navigation links use community slug

### Test 4: Multiple Communities
1. Register 2 different communities
2. Each gets unique slug
3. Login to each → Different dashboards
4. Data is isolated per community

## 📊 **URL Structure:**

### **Old (Single Admin):**
```
/admin/dashboard
/admin/users
/admin/mentors
etc.
```

### **New (Multi-Tenant):**
```
/community/my-learning-hub-abc1/dashboard
/community/my-learning-hub-abc1/students
/community/my-learning-hub-abc1/mentors
/community/my-learning-hub-abc1/contests
/community/my-learning-hub-abc1/analytics
/community/my-learning-hub-abc1/leaderboard
/community/my-learning-hub-abc1/profile

/community/tech-academy-xyz2/dashboard
/community/tech-academy-xyz2/students
etc.
```

## ✅ **Summary:**

**Backend: 100% Complete**
- ✅ Schema with slug field
- ✅ Registration API generates slugs
- ✅ Login API returns community-specific redirects
- ✅ Community API fetches data by slug
- ✅ All admin APIs support filtering by community

**Frontend: 50% Complete**
- ✅ Dashboard page created for `/community/[slug]/dashboard`
- ⏳ Need to copy remaining 6 pages
